title: How It Was Made

It seems fitting that my first post should explain how this blog was made.

This blog runs on [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com "Jekyll home page"), a static blog engine and is hosted with [GitHub pages](pages.github.com). To get started with **Jekyll** I used the [Poole](getpoole.com) scaffolding as outlined in Joshua Lande's excellent [blog post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/).
