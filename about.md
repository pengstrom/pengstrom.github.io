*Welcome, internet citizen. You have stumbled upon my personal blog.*

My name is Per Engstr√∂m, and I'm a developer.

I have a bachelor's degree in physics and are now studying computer science at Uppsala Uiversity. I also take way too many math courses.

I'm employed by the university as an *amanuensis*, meaning I assist the department of Mathematics with education. I'm a good teacher!

This blog runs on [Jekyll](www.jekyllrb.com) and [GitHup Pages](pages.github.com). I got a runing start using a modified version of the [Hyde theme](hyde.getpoole.com) for Jekyll. Instead of the default fonts, I use the *Vollkorn* font from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) in a justified style.
