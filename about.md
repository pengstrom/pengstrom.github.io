*Welcome, internet citizen. You have stumbled upon my personal blog.*

My name is *Per Engstr√∂m*, and I'm a web developer. I'm also a student of computer science and mathematics, a musician and a physics graduate. I'm currently employed at my *alma mater* Uppsala University as an amanuensis at the Department of Mathematics. Before that I was a professional burger-wrangler.

This blog runs on [Jekyll](www.jekyllrb.com) and [GitHup Pages](pages.github.com). I got a runing start using a modified version of the [Hyde theme](hyde.getpoole.com) for Jekyll. Instead of the default fonts, I use the *Vollkorn* font from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) in a justified style.
