*Welcome, internet citizen. You have stumbled upon my personal blog.*

My name is Per Engstr√∂m, and I'm a developer.

I have a bachelor's degree in physics and am now studying computer science at Uppsala University. I also take way too many math courses. When I'm not studying, I help out at the Department of Mathematics as a teacher. I'm also getting involved with the Encore research group at the Department of Computer Science. 

This blog runs on [Jekyll](www.jekyllrb.com) and [GitHup Pages](pages.github.com). I got a running start using a modified version of the [Hyde theme](hyde.getpoole.com) for Jekyll. Instead of the default fonts, I use the *Vollkorn* font from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) in a justified style.
